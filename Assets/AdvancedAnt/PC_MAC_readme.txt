FAQ

- How do I configure a channel to connect to a HR SENSOR ?
To read data from an HR sensor the correct configuration as found in ANT+_Device_Profile_-_Heart_Rate_Rev_2.00.pdf page 11 ont thisisant.com
 AntManager.Instance.OpenChannel(ANT_ReferenceLibrary.ChannelType.BASE_Slave_Receive_0x00, 2, 0, 120, 0, 57, 8070, false); 
 the instantaneous HR is on data[7].
 
 -How to get data from a power Meter ?
 Settings found in ANT+_Device_Profile_-_Bicycle_Power_-_Rev4.2.pdf page 19
 powerDisplay = AntManager.Instance.OpenChannel(ANT_ReferenceLibrary.ChannelType.BASE_Slave_Receive_0x00, 2, 0, 11, 0, 57, 8182, false); 
 then in the data event method, as described in page 31 for Instantaneous Power
 int power= (data[6]) | data[7] << 8;
 
 -How can I auto connect to multiple bike speed sensor ?
 have a look at the MultiBikeSpeedDisplayExample.cs and demo scene. We create a Bike Display class and open a new channel everytime the background scan finds a sensor of the correct type.

 -Why do I get RX Fail messages ?
 Lots of rx fails means the channel period is wrong. Otherwise it is normal to have some amount of rx fails. You can now turn the log off with mychannel.hideRXFAIL = true

 -What are extended info ?
 you will find the info related to the background search extended data in this file:
