# VideoGPXRider
Ride VideoFile with or without GPX, set a transparent Overlay

How it works!

Unity Version 2021.3.36f1

There are some Projects from GitHub and Unity included in this Project:
Unity:
LeanTween
AdvancedPlayerPrefsWindow
Github:
Real Wether and Time Events
FeedReader
StandaloneFileBrowser

The MaleCyclist is a Commercial product, so i can not share it.
You can build your own "RouvyLike" Video Cycling application with it.
In my Version a FEC Device and a HR Monitor ANT+ is needed. You can code your own, all needed files are included.

Make sure you have the Folder in your application root:
" YOUR_EXE\Overlay_data\gpx "

If the Video file match the GPX File the Data is shown as an Image on the UI
Like:
MyRide.gpx
MyRide.mp4
you can find some videos with GPX on my YT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLBt1QHeNA0&list=PLyl8qxxibH53DYUZZVSrpSV-Ur99N6ca8

How i use it:
I load the course also on my Garmin device, and start the course simultan to the VideoGPXRider, so i have a Strava file uploaded and the Garmin sends the trainer difficutly to the FEC Bike.
I bet wahoo devices will also work.
Garmin: Select Training > Indoor Trainer. Select Follow a Course to follow a saved course.

With "PgUp" you can toggle the transparent mode (Watch a Movie, or TV-Series, or a Cycling Tour Live.
Added VP9 Video Codec support for highest Quality
Added more precise sync between video and gpx file.
