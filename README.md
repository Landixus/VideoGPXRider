# VideoGPXRider
Ride VideoFile with or without GPX, set a transparent Overlay

How it works!

Unity Version 2021.3.36f1

There are some Projects from GitHub and Unity included in this Project:
Unity:
LeanTween
AdvancedPlayerPrefsWindow
Github:
Real Wether and Time Events
FeedReader
StandaloneFileBrowser

The MaleCyclist is a Commercial product, so i can not share it.
You can build your own "RouvyLike" Video Cycling application with it.
In my Version a FEC Device and a HR Monitor ANT+ is needed. You can code your own, all needed files are included.

Make sure you have the Folder in your application root:
" YOUR_EXE\Overlay_data\gpx "

If the Video file match the GPX File the Data is shown as an Image on the UI
Like:
MyRide.gpx
MyRide.mp4

Best use on TV with 1920x1080
